"""
Tenki sandbox launcher.

Implements :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher`
for `Tenki <https://tenki.cloud>`_ sandboxes on top of the official
``tenki`` Python SDK. Same posture as the Modal, Daytona, E2B, and
CoreWeave launchers: the SDK is an optional dependency
(``pip install 'omnigent[tenki]'``) imported lazily, so the provider can
be listed and the module probed without it.

Supports both server-managed hosts (``host_type="managed"`` sessions)
and the CLI bootstrap flow. The one unsupported primitive is
``forward_local_port``: Tenki only exposes sandbox ports OUTWARD via a
public URL (``sandbox.expose_port``) — there is no local→sandbox path —
so the in-sandbox Databricks App OAuth flow doesn't apply and managed
hosts authenticate with a server-minted launch token instead.

Notes that shape this launcher:

- **Prepared image required.** A Tenki session boots from a registry
  image reference (``<workspace>/<name>:tag``); the CLI bootstrap only
  overlays the locally-built wheels with ``pip install --no-deps`` and
  the managed flow ships no wheels at all, so the Omnigent host and its
  dependencies must already live in the image. Users build and publish a
  Tenki template with the host baked in (see ``deploy/tenki/README.md``)
  and name it via the ``image`` field / :data:`IMAGE_ENV_VAR`. Registry
  refs are workspace-scoped, so there is no universal default —
  :meth:`provision` fails fast when no image is configured.
- **Networking off by default (SDK).** Tenki's SDK does not enable
  networking unless asked, so :meth:`provision` passes
  ``allow_outbound=True`` explicitly (the host must dial back and clone)
  and ``allow_inbound=False`` (nothing here needs inbound).
- **API-key auth.** ``TENKI_API_KEY`` (or ``TENKI_AUTH_TOKEN``) is read
  from the CLI/server process environment by the SDK, 12-factor — like
  the other providers' keys.
